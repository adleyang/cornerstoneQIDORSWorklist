cornerstoneQIDORSWorklist
=========================

Simple worklist for querying via QIDO-RS

No documentation yet as I am using this project to help learn/understand QIDO for SIIM Hackathon and just
sharing it so others can see what I am figuring out.

You can access this application [here](https://rawgit.com/chafey/cornerstoneQIDORSWorklist/master/src/index.html)

If you need a CORS proxy, try this:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/corsproxy

and use it like this to talk to a DICOMWeb QIDO-RS on http://localhost:8042/qido-rs/studies
